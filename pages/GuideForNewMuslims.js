                <h5>Check for Trial Lessons</h5>
                <p>Many online Quran courses offer trial lessons or free demos. Take advantage of these opportunities to evaluate the course and tutor before committing. This will give you a better idea of what to expect and whether the course meets your expectations.</p>
